Catena_Media Assessment



================================Test Details =========================================
I used  page object model framework to illustrate the tests. All pages are represented by classes in the "main"source folder.

The Tests are contained in the "test" folder of source folder.

I have created 4 tests for demonstration purpose.They are:

Login Test -(it basically falls under smoke and sanity test and it is very mandatory)
Product View Test- ( As an e-commerce site, the product list and view is very important, hence the test)
Add to Cart Test -(It demonstrate user ability to add product(s) to the shopping cart)
End to End test -( This is the complete test from login to checkout to simulate a successful user experience on the application)

I used Extent report  for a rich Html reporting. The report will be generated in the folder "ExtentReport" in  "test-output" as MyReport.html.
